## Overview

This website was developed to be my portfolio through my Software Development career. It shows off a few of my favorite projects I've worked on, several skills I have, and a way to contact me. Each project sections contains a small description, a link to its GitHub repository, and a link to the site if applicable. This project is by far the largest and most complete one I've worked on, and it has been an amazing project to work on and one I will continue to flesh out as time goes on. Additionally, this project has been used to teach myself a load of new-to-me technologies such as Docker, GitHub Actions, React, etc.
